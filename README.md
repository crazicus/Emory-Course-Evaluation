# Emory-Course-Evaluation
A digitalization of Emory University's current inefficient paper system of Semester-End Course Evaluations. A full implementation of this system would save roughly 120,000 sheets of paper every year, and would also allow students to see feedback on courses prior to taking them, a luxury not currently granted.
